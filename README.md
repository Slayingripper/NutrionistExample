# NutrionistExample
This a "small" project i did in school where a nutriotionist can add and create diets for his clients 

## Defining the problem

Mr. George Davis is a nutritionist in Nicosia, Cyprus who has been working for 
over  30  years.  He  is  a  father  of  two  who  tries  to  be  a  good  role  model  both  as  a 
father figure but also to help them adapt ahealthy diet. He has helped thousands of patients  who  not  only  want  to  lose  wait  but  also  suffered  from  lots  of  health 
problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity etc.

##  Current problem

He uses
his large collection of books, he creates unique timetables for each of his patients. 
This requires a massive amount of time since he has to search the books one  by  one. 
He  often  gets  quite  tired  in  his  attempt  to  file  all  this  information  and 
work.  Mr.  Davis  has  chosen  to  use  a manual  system  of  searching  since  he  is  not  too 
fond  of  using  a  computerised  system  even  though  it  is  not  as  efficient  as  he  would 
like it to be. Quite often he needs to search in his files for previous similar cases or to references of problems encountered. This requires too much time and effort. Due to the  large  amount of  information,  some  of  this  is  unfortunately  not  readily available. 
Mr Davis wants to classify each case and correlate if possible. Again the current filing 
makes this an adventure, rather than a feasible task.
